## DIY

To start install Rust

```bash
# MacOS
brew install rust
```
```bash
sudo apt install rust
```

Now we have to change the file inside `tutorial.rs`
```rust
// This is what you will see at the bottom of the file


// This is the main func
fn main() {
    // if you pass through 0 it will run the func
    firstsol(1);
    secondsol(1);
    thirdsol(1);
}

// You will want to change any of these to 0 to run them
```

Then inside of `Tutorial/` run the following

```bash
rustc tutorial.rs
```

Now you will have a working compiled version of `tutorial.rs`

## Docker

Run the command referenced the inside the <a href="../.github/README.md">README</a>
