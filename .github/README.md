This is the `ruby` script (The best preforming one). Feel free to improve any of these or just experiment.

There are 2 different types of scripts in this repo, `fib-op` & `fib`

Im also working on youtube video where I compare all of the languages in this repo in the <b>Grand Coding Language Olympics</b>

### How to use
Run the following in your terminal:
```
docker build -t fib-dock ./
docker run fib-dock
```
This will make a `docker` container and run the script `fib-op.rb`
